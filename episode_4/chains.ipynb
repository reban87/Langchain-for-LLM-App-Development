This is because the peak of its blackbody radiation curve shifts towards shorter wavelengths as its temperature increases.\\n\\nBlackbody radiation is a fundamental concept in physics that helps us understand the radiation emitted by stars, planets, and even everyday objects.

It's where the operating system, currently running programs, and data being actively used are stored. \\n* **Access:** Data in RAM can be **read and written to** quickly and easily.\\n* **Volatility:** RAM is **volatile**, meaning its contents are lost when the power is turned off.\\n* **Example:** When you open a document, it's loaded into RAM. When you close the document, it's removed from RAM.\\n\\n**ROM (Read-Only Memory):**\\n\\n* **Function:** ROM stores **essential system software** (like the BIOS) that is needed to boot the computer. It also stores firmware for devices like hard drives and network cards.\\n* **Access:** Data in ROM can only be **read**, not written to, by the user.\\n* **Volatility:** ROM is **non-volatile**, meaning its contents are retained even when the power is turned off.\\n* **Example:** The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) that helps your computer start up is stored in ROM.\\n\\n**Here's a simple analogy:**\\n\\n* **RAM is like your desk:**  You can put things on it, take things off, and rearrange them as needed. But when you leave the office, everything on your desk disappears.\\n* **ROM is like a manual:** It contains instructions that are always there, but you can't change them. \\n\\n**Key Differences in a Table:**\\n\\n| Feature | RAM | ROM |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| **Function** | Working memory | Stores essential system software |\\n| **Access** | Read and write | Read only |\\n| **Volatility** | Volatile | Non-volatile |\\n| **Speed** | Fast | Slower than RAM |\\n| **Cost** | More expensive | Less expensive |\\n\\n**In summary:** RAM is for temporary storage of data that is actively being used, while ROM stores permanent data that is essential for the computer to function.\\n\""
